# maimabank

This service offers APIs that enable the frontend to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Establish and oversee bank accounts that consist of the account owner's name, balance, and currency.
2. Document all balance adjustments made to each account. Thus, every time an amount is added to or subtracted from an account, an account entry record is generated.
3. Execute a fund transfer between two accounts. This should occur as a transaction, guaranteeing that both accounts' balances are either successfully updated or not updated at all.
